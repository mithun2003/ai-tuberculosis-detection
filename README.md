AI Tuberculosis Detection
</h1>

AI-powered web application for detecting tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images using a deep learning model. The backend is built with **FastAPI**, and the frontend is developed with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 🖼 **Project Overview**

AI Tuberculosis Detection uses machine learning to detect tuberculosis from chest X-ray images. The model is hosted via a FastAPI backend, and the frontend allows users to upload X-ray images and receive real-time predictions.

**Key Highlights:**
- FastAPI-powered backend for quick image processing.
- User-friendly frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Predicts the probability of tuberculosis based on uploaded chest X-rays.
- Real-time preview of the X-ray image before uploading.
